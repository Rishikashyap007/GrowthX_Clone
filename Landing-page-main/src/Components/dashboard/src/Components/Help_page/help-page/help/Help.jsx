    <div className="h1"><b>What‚Äôs the time commitment for the immersion of 8 weeks?</b></div>
    <div className="texta">Over 500+ marketers have done the experience. 
    It‚Äôs designed around a working calendar throughout the week. Most sessions are post 8:30 PM 
    in the night and learning is compressed over the weekends. Also, this is built with a remote-first
    approach and the community is on Slack. 
    <br></br><br></br>To get the most out of each week in the immersion, you should 
    expect to spend 1-2 hours per day on weekly projects (self-paced) plus 4 hours for Sunday live sessions.
    Our most successful participants spend 10 hours per week during the first 8-week immersion program.<br></br><br></br>
    You will apply what you learnt on a Sunday right on the next Monday morning, everything is designed to be actioned. 
    </div>
    <div className="h1"><b>How advanced are the GrowthX learning sprints?</b></div>
    <div className="textb">A better question to ask is: "How relevant is GrowthX content?"
    There are no shortcuts to increasing your impact and doing your best work. GrowthX learning sprints 
    deliver the most value and relevance to the challenges you're facing in your career or business.
    <br></br><br></br>TWhether you're switching career/business focus, looking to make the leap from IC to a leadership role, or simply looking to go deeper on your own job function, we believe GrowthX 
    delivers value to those committed to doing the work and investing their time in learning something new.<br></br><br></br>
    We solve for motivation and skill, we're committed to taking you beyond easy tricks, hacks, and 
    stop-gap solutions that ultimately won't help you advance long-term.
    </div>
    <div className="h1"><b>What is the proof of work we will create?</b></div>
    <div className="textc">Each week, we will progressively solve a part of the growth equation for your product. More than 90% of the members work on a tech product &amp; 
    if you aren't working on one, you will be given options to pick one.
    <br></br>Proof of work is core to retaining learning from the live sprints.<br></br><br></br>
    It is all about building the right problem-solving muscle. If you pick your own product for this assignment,
    you will have a full-blown 
    growth strategy for your own product by week 5, imagine that!
    </div>
    <div className="h1"><b>Do you only cover B2C business models? What about B2B?</b></div>
    <div className="textd"><p>Over 40% of our members work at a B2B SaaS/ full stack org. We build case
    studies from a variety of business models across B2B, B2C, and even B2B2C. Growth as a 
    function has been overly dramatised in the Indian context - the base frameworks are based 
    on high-conviction experimentsthat have done well and you learn stuff that will make you 
    a thinker than a ‚Äúchecklist‚Äù follower.</p>
    <p>Some of the case studies include Razorpay, Wix, Slack, Mailerlite, Hubspot,
    Canva &amp; 10s of more. Some business models we do <span className='bold'>NOT</span> cover include companies
    using only direct sales force based acquisition &amp; enterprises like services companies <em> for example, 
    website building agencies </em> that serve product-based companies.</p>
